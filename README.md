# ***configs for my window manager***

## **info**
This install will install most packages i need for a working system.
There are some things to do to get a fully functionnal system, like symlinking files, and tweaking system configurations.
It will also install either a tiling window manager for either x11 or wayland. I need to make the switch to dwm or xmonad, i3 is terribly bad.

## **install**
run in an arch based distribution
```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/kyazdani42/dotfiles $HOME/.dotfiles
$ cd .dotfiles && ./install.sh
```
