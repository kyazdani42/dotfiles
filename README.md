**just use some basic programs to make your desktop a little better**
```
polybar, feh, compton, dmenu...
```

***no other terminal than alacritty:***
 ```
 Written in rust, and rust is dope
Configuration in yaml is the fucking best
GPU accelerated rendering *(this is cool)*
 ```

\
***stop using fish you f\*ckers***\
Use zsh with vi mode.\
Replace '*.oh-my-zsh/lib/key-bindings.zsh*' bindkey -e with bindkey -v.\
Export KEYTIMEOUT=1 (mandator for vi mode to work properly).

***You guessed it... vim***
```
for f*ck sake, use neovim.
But don't bloat the editor with too many plugins, vim has a pretty decent amount of feature you wan't to learn.
Or install vscod...ium!
```

**installation**

```

***et voila***
